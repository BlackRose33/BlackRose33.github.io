# BlackRose33.github.io
Game Plan to get started:
i. Three pages:
  > Home
    Basic introduction about myself
  > Resume
    My entire resume with each project listed out
  > Artwork
    . Images of all my Artwork
    . Switches the nav panel to a secondary one that has diff art types. Clicking one scrolls the article to the right section of Artwork
    . Maybe a search bar at the top to look for certain images by name or id number

2. Things to learn
  > html/css
    Got to get better at creating dark themed webpages.
  > javascript
    Need to learn more than the basics at some point. Though I would like to avoid using this as much as possible. Maybe once I learn more about security risks of using js then I can look more into it
  > go
    Definitely need to go through the go tour and setup backend in this language.
  > SQL/mongo
    Maybe setup a database of all images for artwork and try getting more practice with mongo since I have some knowledge of SQL.
    I could give each image a unique ID. Each tuple would have an ID, section code, name and the image. Should I use a database for this or just store the images in the img folder...?

...I would start something like this during  finals week -_-
